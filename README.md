# COBOL

A project for learning the basics of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language).


## Software Installation and Setup

I'm using a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LImuEAmVkIw) as the basis of this project.

First I need to install Python on my PC, so I go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/, find version ```3.8.6``` (the latest compatible version with Windows 7), and select ```Download Windows x86 executable installer```.

I right-click on ```python-3.8.6.exe```, select ```Run as administrator```, and click ```Install Now```. I check that Python has been installed by opening ```cmd.exe``` (Windows Command Prompt) as administrator and entering command ```py --version```. The command line outputs ```Python 3.8.6```, so we're good to go.

Next I go to https://pypi.org/project/OpenCobolIDE/ and from there open link https://launchpad.net/cobcide/+download. I download ```OpenCobolIDE-4.7.6_Setup.exe```, run it as administrator, and install it.
