# COBOL

A project for learning the basics of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language).


## Software Installation and Setup

I'm using a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LImuEAmVkIw) as the basis of this project.

First I need to install Python on my PC, so I go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/, find version ```3.8.6``` (the latest compatible version with Windows 7), and select ```Download Windows x86 executable installer```.
